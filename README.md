Grindr Plus is an Xposed Module that unlocks and adds unique features to the Grindr app, enhancing user experience.

## Extra features
> <small>[!IMPORTANT]
> Depending on the version of the client and module you're using, some features may not be available or may work poorly.
- Allow to teleport to any location.
- Allow to save and manage teleport locations.
- Grant most of the Xtra and Unlimited features.
    -   Unlimited cascade view.
    -   Unlocked 'Explore mode'.
    -   Advanced search filters.
    -   Get rid of in-app ads/annoyances.
    -   Ability to save favorite phrases.
- Allow taking screenshots in any part of the app (including albums and expiring photos).
- Unlimited expiring photos and unlimited albums.
- Remove expiration on incoming expiring photos, allowing to see them any number of times you want.
- Extra profile fields and details
    -   Body mass index (BMI) and its description, if both weight and height are available.
    -   Indicator to know whether a user is boosting or not.
    -   Ability to copy profile ID when long pressing on the profile name.
    -   Ability to display hidden (server) profile fields when clicking on the profile name.
- Start video-calls even if you didn't start a chat with the recipient.
- Access to some user-hidden features (developer features).
- More accurate online status from other users. (The green dot from other profiles goes off after 3 minutes of inactivity.)
- Allow unlimited taps (no 24h restriction).
- Ability to prevent people from seeing you in their profile view list.
- Ability to customize the layout for the favorites tab.
- Ability to remove messages from anyone, any time.
- Block app (forced) updates. (The latest version of Grindr will be always fetched and spoofed internally).
- Execute commands in any chat to perform various actions:
    - Use `/teleport` to (virtually) travel to any location by specifying an alias, its name, or coordinates.
    - Retrieve the profile ID of the person you're chatting (+ yours) by using `/id`.
    - Access any profile directly by its ID using `/open`.
    - Discover more commands with `/help`, which provides a list of available commands.

## Bugs
* Incognito mode is kinda buggy (it turns off after a little while).
* Chat markers (read, typing) are not working properly since they're server-side.
* Show blocks in chat is not working properly since it's server-side.
* If using LSPatch, GMS (Google) related features won't work properly (e.g. login with Google or 'Explore' mode).

## How to install
Each Grindr Plus release supports only a specific Grindr app version and quite possibly will not work with any other. Before installing Grindr Plus, some prep work is needed to make sure that you are currenly running and will remain on a supported Grindr version.

### Prep work
<details>
  <summary>See more..</summary>

1. If you use Play Store auto update (most likely), disable auto update for the Grindr app:
    - Go to the Play Store and open the Grindr app page.
    - Click on the 3 dots (overflow menu) and untick "enable auto update".
2. Check the Grindr version currently installed on your device.
    - If it matches the required version, you are ready to install the mod.
    - If it is older than the required version, go to [APKMirror](https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/grindr-llc/grindr-gay-chat-meet-date/) and download and install the required version. Check that Grindr works before proceeding.
    - If your version is newer than the required version, you have 2 options:
        - Wait for the Grindr Plus dev to maybe release a newer Plus. In the meantime, your Grindr will continue to work but will not auto update.
        - Downgrade your Grindr. You are likely rooted, so maybe you have a recent local app backup to restore. Or you can take a backup, install the older version, and restore only the app data afterwards (which might or might not explode in your face). Or you can simply do a clean install of the older version. Consider backing up messages using the Grindr backup service before uninstalling. And you might want to take a local app backup too, just in case. **However you downgrade Grindr, you probably need to immediately disable Play Store auto update again afterwards.** And double-check that Grindr works before continuing.

## FAQ & Troubleshooting
<details>
  <summary>My Grindr app suddenly stops / crashes when the module is installed!</summary> 

- Check if the module supports the app version. Grindr has lots of obfuscated symbols that change in each app update and the module couldn't work (or couldn't work properly).
</details>
<details>
  <summary>I've updated to Android 14 (QPR2) / Android 15 and LSPosed stopped working!</summary> 

- The development of LSPosed is currently frozen and that is why, no new updates have been released to support new Android versions. As an alternative, you can use [this **unofficial** fork](https://github.com/mywalkb/LSPosed_mod).
</details>
<details>
  <summary>I'm using LSPatch and I can't login with Google!</summary> 

- As mentioned above, when using LSPatch the original signature of the application is invalidated which causes all functions related to Google Services (GMS) to not work properly.
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Can I get banned with this?</summary>

- Obviously, however, the risk is very low, and there have been no reported cases of bans related to using this mod.
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Where can I download the latest stable build?</summary>

- https://github.com/R0rt1z2/GrindrPlus/releases
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Can I suggest a new feature?</summary>

- Feel free to, but keep in mind that every feature, no matter how small, has a lot of work behind it, so please be patient and understand that sometimes it is impossible to implement certain things due to the nature of how LSPosed works.
